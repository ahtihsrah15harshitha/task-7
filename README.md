 Managing Browser Extensions (Safely)
✅ Best Practices
Install Only from Official Stores

Use Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or trusted sources.

Avoid downloading extensions from third-party websites.

Review Permissions

Check what data the extension can access (e.g., read browsing history, access tabs).

If it asks for more than it needs—avoid it.

Regularly Review and Remove

Go to your extensions page (chrome://extensions/, about:addons) and remove unused or suspicious ones.

Keep Extensions and Browser Updated

Updates patch security vulnerabilities.

Read Reviews and Developer Info

Look for red flags in user reviews or suspicious developer names.

Use Minimal Extensions

Fewer extensions mean fewer risks. Stick to essentials only.
